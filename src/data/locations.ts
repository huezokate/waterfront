          "San Francisco's first de facto city hall was the Jenny Lind Theater, a three-story brick building on Portsmouth Square that the city purchased in 1852 and converted into municipal offices. The Gold Rush had made San Francisco one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, and its government scrambled to keep pace with a population of fortune-seekers, merchants, and adventurers. The makeshift city hall was already inadequate before it opened.",

The structure that had taken nearly three decades and enormous graft to build came down in seconds, its hollow walls a testament to what happened when public money was treated as private loot. Only the dome structure and some walls survived.",

Architects Bakewell and Brown drew on the great civic architecture of Paris and Washington to create a building that declared San Francisco's renewed ambition after the earthquake. The rotunda's natural light, its marble floors, and its soaring scale made it immediately the city's most inspiring public space.",

Thousands gathered outside in a spontaneous candlelight vigil that became one of the most affecting public mourning ceremonies in American history. The subsequent \"Twinkie defense\" verdict and the White Night riots transformed San Francisco's politics permanently.",

The street was too wide for the city that existed — a visionary gesture toward the metropolis O'Farrell believed would come.

The earthquake and fire destroyed almost everything east of Van Ness Avenue, and Market Street\'s ruins became the most photographed symbol of the disaster. Reconstruction began within days, with the street\'s bones guiding the rebuilt city.',

The 1967 anti-war march that drew 100,000 participants was among the first massive national anti-war demonstrations, organized from a city that had become the de facto capital of American dissent.

The tax incentives that attracted them expired; some companies moved or shrank; and Mid-Market's transformation remained incomplete and contested.
